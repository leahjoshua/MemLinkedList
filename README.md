A custom doubly linked list implementation simulating memory allocation/deallocation made for Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis. It accepts user input through console to: request and release memory and display list. User may only request up to the total amount of free memory in a single node, and can only free the amount of memory in an allocated node.
